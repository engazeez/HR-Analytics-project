## Overview of Data Files
#### There are three CSV data files:
- train_features.csv: Each row represents metadata for an individual job posting.
 
  The “jobId” column represents a unique identifier for the job posting. 
  The remaining columns describe features of the job posting.

- train_salaries.csv: Each row associates a “jobId” with a “salary”.
- test_features.csv: Similar to train_features.csv, each row represents metadata for an individual job posting.


## The task
Building a model to predict the salaries for the job postings contained in test_features.csv.
